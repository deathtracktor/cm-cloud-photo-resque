Resque your valuable photos from the CM Cloud before it's too late!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Use this utility to resque your photographs from `CM Cloud`,
the default backup option of the excellent `QuickPic` image browser for Android.
You can also use Windows-only, closed-source [CM Cloud download tool](https://cloud.cmcm.com/client_cloud_res/cmqp/resource/tool/cloud_gallery_download.exe)
